# Resources for Internet of Things Webinar  
Ensure you have an active IBM Cloud account, if not sign up using [this link](https://ibm.biz/BdZRMN)  

## Getting started  
- Deploy the Internet of Things boilerplate on the IBM Cloud  
- Access the Node-RED editor and create your login credentials  
- Add the following nodes to the pallet (**node-red-contrib-browser-utils**, **node-red-dashboard** and **node-red-node-weather-underground**)  
- Import the Node-RED  [flow](https://github.com/binnes/iotWebinar/blob/master/webinar.flow) from this git repo  
- Add the conversation, speech to text and text to speech (and optionally the translation) services to the IBM Cloud application   
- Import the Conversation workspace into the IBM Cloud conversation service from   [here](https://github.com/binnes/tobyjnr/blob/master/conversation/TobyJnr_conversation_workspace.json)  
- Add the credentials for the IBM Cloud services to the nodes in the flow  

## Additional resources  
The sample flow used in this webinar is a simplified extract from another project, which can be found [here](https://github.com/binnes/tobyjnr), which you may want to check out.  

There are 2 Coursera courses available which will allow you to investigate the Watson IoT platform on the IBM Cloud and Node-RED further.   You can choose to audit the courses if you prefer not to pay and receive the certificate, or pay the fee to gain the Coursera certificate for the course(s):  
- [A developer's guide to the Internet of Things (IoT)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/developer-iot/home)  
- [A Developer's guide to Node-RED](https://www.coursera.org/learn/developer-nodered/home)  

There is also a large set of resources on [IBM Code](https://developer.ibm.com/code/) including the [Bot Asset Exchange](https://developer.ibm.com/code/exchanges/bots/), where you will find a large collection of conversation samples and resources.

Quickstart link
- [IoT sensor simulator](https://quickstart.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/iotsensor)  
- [Quickstart](https://quickstart.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com)

The [Node-RED site](https://nodered.org) contains documentation, sample flows and information about additional nodes available.  

## Challenge
For the next webinar we would like you to create your own conversation service incorporating data from an IoT source, maybe your smartphone, a real device or the quickstart simulator?  On the next webinar you will have the opportunity to ask questions and discuss any areas where you encountered difficulty.
